# Meeting Notes: Testing Update

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Attendees:** John Doe, Jane Smith

## 1. Overview

This document summarizes the key discussion points and action items from the testing update meeting held on October 26, 2023.  The primary topic discussed was the status of "Testing 2," which refers to the second round of testing on the core application module.

## 2. Testing 2: Round Two Testing Update

The second round of testing has commenced on the core application module. Initial findings indicate several areas of concern related to performance and data validation. A more detailed report will be available by October 28, 2023.

Key areas being focused on in this round include:

*   **Performance:** Evaluating response times under simulated peak load conditions.
*   **Data Validation:** Verifying data integrity across different modules.
*   **Security:** Assessing vulnerability to common attack vectors.

The initial test results highlighted the following:

*   Slower than expected response times under heavy load.
*   Data inconsistencies when processing large datasets.
*   Potential security vulnerabilities related to user authentication.

## 3. Issues Identified

The following issues were identified during the testing process:

*   **Performance Degradation:** Observed a significant drop in performance during peak hours.  Details in JIRA-123.
*   **Data Corruption:** Found instances of data corruption when migrating data between databases. Details in JIRA-124.
*   **Security Vulnerability:** Identified a potential vulnerability in the user authentication module. Details in JIRA-125.

## 4. Action Items

The following action items were assigned to address the identified issues:

*   **John Doe:** Review and fix reported performance degradation bugs (JIRA-123). - Due Date: November 2, 2023
*   **Jane Smith:** Investigate and resolve data corruption issues (JIRA-124). - Due Date: November 2, 2023
*   **John Doe & Jane Smith:** Investigate and remediate security vulnerability in user authentication (JIRA-125) - Due Date: November 2, 2023
*   **Jane Smith:** Prepare detailed test report summarizing the findings from round two testing. - Due Date: October 28, 2023

## 5. Decisions Made

*   **Priority:** Addressing the security vulnerability (JIRA-125) is the highest priority action item.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Additional resources will be allocated to address the performance degradation issues (JIRA-123).

## 6. Next Steps

*   Continue with planned test cases as outlined in the Test Plan Document: "Application Core Testing Plan v2.0".
*   Review the results of round two testing, focusing on the detailed report due October 28, 2023.
*   Address outstanding bugs and prepare for re-testing after fixes are implemented and verified.
*   Schedule a follow-up meeting on November 3, 2023, to review the progress on the action items and plan for the next phase of testing.
