# 🌱 Eden HQ

> The central coordination hub for the Eden robotics project under the Turtle initiative

## 🤖 Mission Statement

Eden is an ambitious robotics project that combines cutting-edge software, innovative hardware design, and artificial intelligence to create autonomous robotic systems. Our mission is to push the boundaries of what's possible in robotics through:

- **Software Excellence**: ROS 2-based architecture with AI/ML integration
- **Hardware Innovation**: Custom PCB design and 3D-printed components
- **Community-Driven**: Open-source development with comprehensive documentation

## 📁 Repository Directory

Eden is organized across multiple specialized repositories:

| Repository | Purpose | Status |
