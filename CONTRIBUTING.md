# ü§ù Contributing to Eden

> Guidelines for contributing to the Eden robotics project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Eden! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors across all Eden repositories.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Fork** the repository you want to contribute to
2. **Clone** your fork locally
3. **Create** a feature branch
4. **Make** your changes
5. **Test** your changes thoroughly
6. **Submit** a pull request

## üìã Before You Start

### Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Git and GitHub
- Familiarity with the project's technology stack
- Understanding of the project's goals and architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Software**: ROS 2, Python, C++, Docker
- **Hardware**: SolidWorks, KiCad, 3D printing
- **Documentation**: Markdown, Mermaid diagrams

## üîß Development Workflow

### 1. Issue Creation
Before starting work, please:
- Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
- Use the appropriate issue template
- Provide clear description and context
- Label issues appropriately (bug, enhancement, documentation)

### 2. Branch Naming
Use descriptive branch names:
```bash
# Good examples
feature/navigation-slam
bugfix/motor-control-timing
docs/api-documentation
hotfix/critical-security-patch

# Avoid
fix
update
changes
```

### 3. Commit Messages
Follow the conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(navigation): add SLAM implementation
fix(hardware): correct motor driver pinout
docs(api): update ROS 2 service documentation
```

### 4. Pull Request Process
- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized
- Include clear description of changes
- Reference related issues
- Ensure all tests pass
- Request review from maintainers

## üìÅ Repository-Specific Guidelines

## üìù Code Style

### Python (eden-software)
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Maximum line length: 88 characters
- Use `black` for code formatting
- Use `flake8` for linting

### C++ (eden-software)
- Follow Google C++ Style Guide
- Use `clang-format` for formatting
- Use `cpplint` for style checking
- Prefer modern C++ features (C++17+)

### Documentation
