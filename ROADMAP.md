## üõ†Ô∏è How to Update This Roadmap

### Adding New Tasks
1. **Edit ROADMAP.md** and find the Mermaid code block
2. **Add new line** in the appropriate section:
   ```markdown
   Your New Task        :status, task-id, start-date, end-date
   ```
3. **Status options**: `done`, `active`, `crit` (critical), or custom
4. **Test your changes**: Use [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live)
