EDEN Project Meeting - September 19, 2025

Attendees: Ved, AI Assistant, Development Team

Agenda:
- Repository structure setup
- Meeting notes application development
- Next steps for EDEN project

Discussion:

We successfully set up the EDEN repository structure with 6 repositories:
- eden-core (shared software libraries)
- eden-hardware-core (shared CAD/electronics)
- eden-adam-software (Adam's unique RL + personality)
- eden-adam-hardware (Adam's unique CAD)
- eden-eve-software (Eve's unique RL + personality)
- eden-eve-hardware (Eve's unique CAD)

The repositories are now live on GitHub under the EDEN-robotics organization. All README files have been updated with correct URLs and documentation.

For the meeting notes application, we created a Word-like GUI using tkinter with Gemini AI integration. The app allows users to:
- Type notes naturally
- Format with AI assistance
- Export to markdown for GitHub
- Generate summaries and action items
- Improve grammar automatically

Key decisions made:
- Use Google Gemini AI for natural language processing
- Create a familiar Word-like interface
- Export to markdown for GitHub compatibility
- Include comprehensive documentation and setup instructions

Action items:
- Set up submodules for the repositories (follow setup-submodules.md)
- Test the meeting notes application
- Begin development on Adam's RL algorithms
- Start working on Eve's personality system
- Create initial CAD designs for both robots

Next meeting scheduled for next week to review progress and discuss implementation details.

Meeting ended at 6:45 PM.
